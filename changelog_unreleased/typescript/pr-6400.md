#### Babel as an alternative parser for TypeScript ([#6400](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/6400) by [@JounQin](https://github.com/JounQin) & [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

A new value for the `parser` option has been added: `babel-ts`, which stands for Babel with its TypeScript support enabled. The `babel-ts` parser supports JavaScript features not yet supported by TypeScript (ECMAScript proposals, e.g. [private methods and accessors](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-methods)), but it's less permissive when it comes to error recovery and less battle-tested than the `typescript` parser. While Babel's TypeScript plugin is quite mature, ASTs produced by the two parsers aren't 100% compatible. We tried to take the discrepancies into account, but there still must remain cases where code gets formatted differently or even incorrectly. We call upon the community to help us find such cases. If you see them, please raise issues. In the long run, this will help with [unifying the AST format](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/typescript-estree#ast-alignment-tests) in future versions of the parsers and thus contribute to a better, more solid JavaScript parser ecosystem.
