#### Use do-not-indent sequence in mapping style for Kubernetes resources (#10927 by @tumido)

By default Prettier prefers do-indent style for sequences in mappins, see [#4723](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/4723). However the growing popularity of the do-not-indent style in projects related to Kubernetes makes us introduce a special behavior. If a YAML file contains a Kubernetes-like resource manifest, Prettier will use a do-not-indent style. We simply assume that any YAML file containing `apiVersion` and `kind` key at the document root is a Kubernetes resource manifest.

```yaml
--- # Regular YAML file (do indent style)
key0:
  - item0
  - item1
key1:
  key2:
    - item0
    - item1

--- # Kubernetes resource manifest (BEFORE)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: name
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - configmaps
      - services
      - secrets
    verbs:
      - create
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - update
      - patch
      - delete

--- # Kubernetes resource manifest (AFTER)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: name
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - configmaps
  - services
  - secrets
  verbs:
  - create
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
```
