#### Allow to set amount of spaces between comments and content (#10926 by @tumido)

Prettier now enables user to comply with default settings of YAML linters like `yamllint` where it is expected to separate a document content and comments on the same line by multiple spaces. New CLI option `--comment-spaces-from-content` is introduced.

```yaml
# Default
--- # Comment at document head
key0: value0 # Trailing comment

# With `--comment-spaces-from-content 2`
---  # Comment at document head
key0: value0  # Trailing comment
```
