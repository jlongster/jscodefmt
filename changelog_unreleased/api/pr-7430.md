#### Change default value for `arrowParens` to `always` ([#7430](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7430) by [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev))

[Since version 1.9](https://prettier.io/blog/2017/12/05/1.9.0.html#option-to-add-parens-in-arrow-function-arguments-3324httpsgithubcomprettierprettierpull3324-by-rattrayalexhttpsgithubcomrattrayalex-and-suchipihttpsgithubcomsuchipi), Prettier has an [option](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#arrow-function-parentheses) to always wrap arrow function arguments with parentheses.
Since version 2.0, this behavior becomes default.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
const fn = (x) => y => x + y;

// Prettier stable
const fn = x => y => x + y;

// Prettier master
const fn = (x) => (y) => x + y;
```

At first glance, avoiding parentheses in the isolated example above may look like a better choice because of less visual noise.
However, when Prettier removes parentheses, it becomes harder to add type annotations, extra arguments or default values as well as making [other changes](https://twitter.com/ManuelBieh/status/1181880524954050560).
Consistent use of parentheses provides a better developer experience when editing real codebases, which justifies the change.

You are encouraged to use the new default value, but if the old behavior is still preferred, please configure Prettier with `{ "arrowParens": "avoid" }`.
